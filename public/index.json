Our model, GraphiT, encodes such information by (i) leveraging relative positional encoding strategies in self-attention scores based on positive definite kernels on graphs, and (ii) enumerating and encoding local sub-structures such as paths of short length. We thoroughly evaluate these two ideas on many classification and regression tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of each of them independently, as well as their combination. In addition to performing well on standard benchmarks, our model also admits natural visualization mechanisms for interpreting graph motifs explaining the predictions, making it a potentially strong candidate for scientific applications where interpretation is important.","tags":[],"title":"GraphiT: Encoding Graph Structure in Transformers","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1622505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622505600,"objectID":"0434fd54ac4e20753721fbfc74120b42","permalink":"https://GregoireMialon.github.io/talk/nyu_graphit/","publishdate":"2022-04-15T15:11:02+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/nyu_graphit/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"GraphiT: Encoding Graph Structure in Transformers","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Grégoire Mialon","Gustave Ronteix"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1614681802,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614681802,"objectID":"3415830f2364fe8a233464077c6a7744","permalink":"https://GregoireMialon.github.io/post/alex-itw/","publishdate":"2021-03-02T11:43:22+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/alex-itw/","section":"post","summary":"Gustave Ronteix et moi-même avons interrogé Alexandre Gramfort, chercheur en machine learning à Inria Saclay, pour le Grand Continent.
