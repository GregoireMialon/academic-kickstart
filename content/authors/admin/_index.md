I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) in Paris, where I am advised by Yann LeCun. My research currently focuses on self-supervised learning. I am also curious about technology and its implications in politics and entrepreneurship. I sometimes write on these subjects for different organizations such as the [Group for Geopolitical Studies](https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/), a european think-tank hosted at [École normale supérieure](https://www.ens.fr/).

Prior to that, I was a PhD Student in Machine Learning in the [Sierra research team](https://www.di.ens.fr/sierra/index.php) at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/fr), where I was co-advised by [Julien Mairal](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/) and [Alexandre d'Aspremont](https://www.di.ens.fr/~aspremon/). During my PhD, I proposed architectural improvements for learning from small or medium sized datasets such as scientific data.
